Project Idea: 
We are looking to create a desktop application that aims to keep user information secure by providing 
a wide range of cyber security tools. Users should be able to easily create an account, upload files, 
and encrypt/decrypt data. We want the application to be as user friendly as possible so that users can 
feel at ease and in control. Keeping the application up to date with the latest bug fixes and updates is of the utmost importance.
